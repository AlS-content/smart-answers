Same-sex relationships in Switzerland that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as ’eingetragene Partnerschaft’, ’partenariat enregistré’, ’unione domestica registrata’ or ’partenadi registrà’ (’registered partnership’).

##Before you start

s1. Contact the Civil Register Office where you’re entering into a civil partnership to find out about the availability of dates, local laws and what documents you’ll need.

s2. Contact the [Swiss Embassy in London](https://www.eda.admin.ch/london) to start the civil partnership process.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/publications/switzerland-list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Switzerland](/foreign-travel-advice/switzerland) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You may need to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) or a civil status declaration to prove you're allowed to enter into a civil partnership in Switzerland.

### Get a CNI

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your civil partnership. A CNI costs £35.
 
^Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)^
 
You’ll need to bring [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-to-take-to-the-register-office) with you to your appointment.
 
Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection.
 
If your CNI was issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, it will usually be valid at the town hall for 6 months. If it was issued in Scotland, it will expire after 3 months. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)
 
You’ll need to get your CNI [legalised](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO).
 
You’ll also need to get a certified translation of your CNI. Use an [approved translator](/government/publications/poland-list-of-translators-and-interpreters).


###Get a civil status declaration

You can get a civil status declaration from the British Embassy in Berne in the language of the canton where the ceremony is taking place.

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) or [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the consulate to find out what you need

If you’ve been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you'll also need to bring the appropriate original document:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.

%The name on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passport - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the ceremony to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage or civil partnership certificate, or deed poll).%

You should check if your civil status declaration needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Switzerland.

##Naturalisation of your partner

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
