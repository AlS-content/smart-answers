## Working on site

To keep employees and volunteers safe you should:

- make sure on-site employees can [spot symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/)
- tell workers with symptoms to [quarantine immediately](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/what-to-do-if-you-or-someone-you-live-with-has-coronavirus-symptoms/staying-at-home-if-you-or-someone-you-live-with-has-coronavirus-symptoms/)
- explain new procedure and provide training where necessary
- consider the protected characteristics of your employees when making decisions, and to prevent discrimination

To support employees working remotely you should:

- provide the right equipment for people to work from home
- keep remote and on-site employees connected
- send updates to employees when the situation changes
- make sure you consider employees' needs (you have a responsibility to [prevent discrimination at work](/employer-preventing-discrimination))
- [look after people’s mental health](/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-public-on-mental-health-and-wellbeing/guidance-for-the-public-on-the-mental-health-and-wellbeing-aspects-of-coronavirus-covid-19)

From August 1, clinically extremely vulnerable people can go to work as long as the workplace is covid-secure, but should carry on working from home if possible. If they cannot work from home, they should be offered the safest available roles at work so they can maintain social distancing.
It might be appropriate for clinically extremely vulnerable peole to do an alternative role or adjust their working pattern temporarily.

You should have individual discussions with your workers where reasonable, including those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and therefore may be returning to the workplace, to consider any uncertainties they have about precautions in place to make the workplace safer.

If you are concerned about returning to work, [check if you should go back to work](https://www.gov.uk/check-how-to-return-to-work-safely).

### NHS Test and Trace

There is a higher risk of transmitting COVID‑19 in premises where customers and visitors spend more time together in one place and potentially come into close contact with other people outside their household.

To manage this risk, establishments in the following sectors should collect details and maintain records of staff, customers and visitors:

- hospitality, including pubs, bars, restaurants and cafés
- tourism and leisure, including hotels, museums, cinemas, zoos and theme parks
- close contact services, including hairdressers, barbershops and tailors
- facilities provided by local authorities, including town halls and civic centres for events, community centres, libraries and children’s centres
- places of worship, including use for events and other community activities

This guidance applies to any establishment that provides an on-site service and to any events that take place on its premises.

It does not apply where services are taken off-site immediately. (For example, a food or drink outlet which only provides takeaways, or someone collecting a pre-reserved book from the library. If a business offers a mixture of a sit-in and takeaway service, contact information only needs to be collected for customers who are staying in.)

This guidance does not apply to drop-off deliveries made by suppliers or contractors.

You should assist the test and trace service by keeping a temporary record of your staff shift patterns for 21 days and assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that data if needed. This could help contain clusters or outbreaks.

[Check the detailed guidance](/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace#information-to-collect) for what data you need to collect and how it should be managed.
