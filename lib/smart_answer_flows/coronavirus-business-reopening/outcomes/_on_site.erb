## Decide who should be on site 

Only essential employees and people who cannot work from home should be on site.

You should not go to work if your business is closed under current government regulations.

Clinically [extremely vulnerable people](/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#who-is-clinically-extremely-vulnerable) or [vulnerable people](/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing#clinically-vulnerable-people) should always work from home.

If you are concerned about returning to work, [check if you should go back to work.](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus-employee-risk-assessment)

To keep employees and volunteers safe you should:

- minimise the number of people on site
- make sure on-site employees can [spot symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/)
- tell workers with symptoms to [quarantine immediately](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/what-to-do-if-you-or-someone-you-live-with-has-coronavirus-symptoms/staying-at-home-if-you-or-someone-you-live-with-has-coronavirus-symptoms/)
- explain new procedure and provide training where necessary
- consider the protected characteristics of your employees when making decisions, and to prevent discrimination

To support employees working remotely you should:

- provide the right equipment for people to work from home
- keep remote and on-site employees connected
- send updates to employees when the situation changes
- make sure disabled workers and new and expectant mothers can do their work from home (you have a responsibility to [prevent discrimination at work](/employer-preventing-discrimination))
- [look after people’s mental health](/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-public-on-mental-health-and-wellbeing/guidance-for-the-public-on-the-mental-health-and-wellbeing-aspects-of-coronavirus-covid-19)

### NHS Test and Trace

There is a higher risk of transmitting COVID‑19 in premises where customers and visitors spend more time together in one place and potentially come into close contact with other people outside their household.

To manage this risk, establishments in the following sectors should collect details and maintain records of staff, customers and visitors:

- hospitality, including pubs, bars, restaurants and cafés
- tourism and leisure, including hotels, museums, cinemas, zoos and theme parks
- close contact services, including hairdressers, barbershops and tailors
- facilities provided by local authorities, including town halls and civic centres for events, community centres, libraries and children’s centres
- places of worship, including use for events and other community activities

This guidance applies to any establishment that provides an on-site service and to any events that take place on its premises.

It does not apply where services are taken off-site immediately. (For example, a food or drink outlet which only provides takeaways, or someone collecting a pre-reserved book from the library. If a business offers a mixture of a sit-in and takeaway service, contact information only needs to be collected for customers who are staying in.)

This guidance does not apply to drop-off deliveries made by suppliers or contractors.

You should assist the test and trace service by keeping a temporary record of your staff shift patterns for 21 days and assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that data if needed. This could help contain clusters or outbreaks.

[Check the detailed guidance](/guidance/maintaining-records-of-staff-customers-and-visitors-to-support-nhs-test-and-trace#information-to-collect) for what data you need to collect and how it should be managed.
