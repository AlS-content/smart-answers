This guidance can help you carry out your risk assessment to make sure you keep employees and other people on site safe when opening during coronavirus (COVID-19).

  ## Record your risk assessment

  You need to write down the findings of your risk assessment. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has a [risk assessment template](https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/risk-assessment-template-and-examples.htm) and [information on how to do a risk assessment](https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/steps-needed-to-manage-risk.htm).

  Your employees can help with the risk assessment.

  - limit the number of visitors or customers at any one time so people can social distance
  - get contractors to work from home unless it’s essential for them to be on site
  - keep contact with contractors to a minimum
  - keep a record of visitors if you can
  - put up signs to stay 2 meters apart
  - have 2 meter floor markings for queues
