This guidance can help you carry out your risk assessment to make sure you keep employees and other people on site safe when opening during coronavirus (COVID‑19).

You should also consider the security implications of any decisions and control measures you intend to put in place, as any revisions could present new or altered security risks that may require mitigation.

This guidance is to help you prepare to open your business from 4th of July.

  ## Record your risk assessment

  You need to write down the findings of your risk assessment. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has a [risk assessment template](https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/risk-assessment-template-and-examples.htm) and [information on how to do a risk assessment](https://www.hse.gov.uk/simple-health-safety/risk/steps-needed-to-manage-risk.htm).

  You should involve your employees when completing the risk assessment.

  You should consider the protected characteristics of your employees, visitors and customers when conducting your risk assessment.

  You should share the results of your risk assessment with your workforce by displaying it prominently in your workplace, as well as on your website.

  ## Protecting customers and visitors on site

  You should:

  - work out the maximum number of customers that can reasonably follow social distancing guidelines (where they can stay 2 metres apart from other customers or 1 metre with risk mitigation where 2 metres is not viable)
  - inform customers and visitors of guidance about visiting the premises before they arrive (for example, by providing information on your website, booking forms, or over the phone)
  - use signs and provide clear information to your customers and visitors when they arrive
  - encourage customers to use hand sanitiser or handwashing facilities when they enter the premises
  - remind customers accompanied by children that they are responsible for supervising them at all times
  - adjust indoor and outdoor seating and tables to maintain social distancing guidelines
  - ensure that customers of the same household or support bubble can be seated together indoors
  - ensure that customers of up to two households or support bubbles can be seated together indoors with social distancing
  - ensure that customers of the same households or support bubble can be seated or stood together outdoors
  - ensure that customers of up to two households or support bubbles or a group of six people from any number of households can be seated or stood together outside with social distancing
  - work with your local authority or landlord to take into account the impact of your processes, including queues, on public spaces such as high streets and public car parks
  - work with neighbouring businesses and local authorities to provide additional parking or facilities such as bike-racks, where possible, to help customers avoid using public transport
  - reduce the need for customers to queue, but where this is unavoidable, discourage customers from queueing indoors and use outside spaces for queueing where available and safe (for example, using car parks and existing outdoor services areas)
  - manage queues to ensure they do not cause a risk to individuals, other businesses or additional security risks
  - consider the needs of people’s protected characteristics, (such as age or disability when modifying the premise)
