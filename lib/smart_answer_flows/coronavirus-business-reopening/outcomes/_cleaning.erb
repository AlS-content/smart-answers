## Cleaning

% If someone has symptoms follow the [specific instructions for cleaning after a case of COVID‑19](/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings).  %

To minimise the risk of the virus spreading you should:

- clean the site before you reopen
- clean work areas, surfaces and equipment frequently between use with your usual cleaning products
- clean busy areas frequently and thoroughly
- restrict the use of items that are touched often
- provide more bins and empty them more often
- clear workspaces and remove waste and belongings from the area at the end of a shift
- use different gowns and towels for each client
- make sure that housekeeping staff follow government handwashing guidelines, and make a checklist of all surfaces to be cleaned when each guest vacates
- clean keys between guests
- consider whether the cleaning and disinfecting products you plan to use are appropriate (such as when working on historic surfaces and heritage sites), and if not, consider alternative approaches such as using temporary non-damaging covers over the sensitive surfaces and cleaning those, or not allowing visitors in the sensitive areas 


### Handwashing, toilets, changing rooms and showers

You should:

- use signs and posters with instructions for employees to wash their hands for 20 seconds as often as possible, to avoid touching their faces and to catch coughs and sneezes in tissues
- remind employees regularly to wash their hands
- provide hand sanitiser throughout the site and in washrooms
- make sure toilets are kept clean at all times
- provide paper towels or electric dryers
- close changing rooms and showers, if you can
- make sure all water systems, for example showers and sinks, are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown to [minimise the risk of legionella](https://www.hse.gov.uk/coronavirus/legionella-risks-during-coronavirus-outbreak.htm) and other diseases
- set clear use and cleaning guidance for showers, lockers and changing rooms if they have to be kept open (for example, in a gym) 
- encourage participants and staff to change and shower at home rather than in changing rooms where possible (for example, when going to the gym) 

^If you cannot close changing rooms and showers, keep them free of all personal items (such as clothes, towels and toiletries). Clean everything, including lockers, more often and thoroughly during and at the end of the day.^

### Handling goods, equipment, merchandise and vehicles

There may be a risk of the virus coming into the workplace through goods, merchandise or vehicles. To avoid this you should:

- make sure workers handling goods and merchandise know to wash their hands more often
- provide more handwashing facilities and hand sanitisers
- have a process for cleaning goods and merchandise coming into the workplace or onsite
- clean things like reusable delivery boxes regularly
- minimise client contact with testers
- sanitise all hand tools, controls, machinery and equipment after use
- frequently clean anything that’s touched regularly (such as buckets, site equipment, door handles, pump handles and printers)
- clean the parts of shared equipment you touch after each use, for example tools and vehicles such as pallet trucks and forklift trucks
- make sure you have adequate disposal arrangements
- regularly clean vehicles, for example pallet trucks and forklift trucks as well as cars or vans that workers take home
- take special care when cleaning portable toilets
- restart and test specialist equipment that’s been unused for longer than usual
- work out how to clean expensive equipment that cannot be washed down and design protection around machines and equipment
- have adequate disposal arrangements
- reduce or avoid use of any non-personal kit 

<% if calculator.sector?("hotels") %>
For guests in hotels, hostels, B&Bs, caravan parks and campsites you should:

- assign shared shower facilities to just one household group, or run a reservation-and-clean process (allowing just one household to exclusively use shared facilities for a fixed time, cleaning it thoroughly, before allowing the next household)
- set clear use and cleaning guidance for shared toilets, including asking guests to remove their personal items and maintaining social distancing
- inform guests about the increased risk of using these facilities
- make sure that shared facilities like water points, waste points or washing up points are cleaned regularly
<% end %>

### Ventilation

Before you reopen you should:

- check if you need to service or adjust ventilation systems, for example they shouldn’t automatically reduce ventilation when there are fewer people on site
- get advice from your heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) engineer if your systems serve several buildings and you’re not sure if they need adjusting

Positive pressure systems and extractors can operate as normal.

  ### Other people’s homes

  If you work in people’s homes you need to minimise the risk of passing infection on to other people.

  You should:

  - wash your hands frequently for 20 seconds using soap and hot water, particularly after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose
  - cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze with a tissue or sleeve – not your hands – and throw the tissue in the bin immediately and wash your hands
  - clean objects and surfaces that you touch regularly, using your usual cleaning products
  - carry hand sanitiser if there’s nowhere to wash your hands
  - follow hygiene measures when tools or supplies, such as building supplies, are delivered to a home
  - collect materials in bulk to reduce how often you visit shops to buy or collect materials
  - get rid of waste in bulk if possible
  - remove all waste and belongings at the end of a job and arrange with the householder how to safely dispose of the waste.
