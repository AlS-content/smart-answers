## Cleaning

% If someone has symptoms follow the [specific instructions for cleaning after a case of COVID‑19](/government/publications/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings/covid-19-decontamination-in-non-healthcare-settings).  %

To minimise the risk of the virus spreading you should:

- clean the site before you reopen
- clean work areas, surfaces and equipment frequently between use with your usual cleaning products
- clean busy areas more often and more thoroughly
- restrict the use of items that are touched often
- provide more bins and empty them more often
- clear workspaces and remove waste and belongings from the area at the end of a shift
- use different gowns and towels for each client

### Handwashing, toilets, changing rooms and showers

You should:

- use signs and posters with instructions for employees to wash their hands for 20 seconds as often as possible, to avoid touching their faces and to catch coughs and sneezes in tissues
- remind employees regularly to wash their hands, especially if they handle goods and merchandise
- provide hand sanitiser throughout the site and in washrooms
- provide handwashing facilities or hand sanitiser where people handle goods and merchandise
- make sure toilets are kept clean at all times
- provide paper towels or electric dryers
- close changing rooms and showers, if you can

^If you cannot close changing rooms and showers, keep them free of all personal items (such as clothes, towels and toiletries). Clean everything, including lockers, more often and thoroughly during and at the end of the day.^

### Handling goods, equipment, merchandise and vehicles

There may be a risk of the virus coming into the workplace through goods, merchandise or vehicles. To avoid this you should:

- make sure workers handling goods and merchandise know to wash their hands more often
- provide more handwashing facility if possible and hand sanitiser, if not
- have a process for cleaning goods and merchandise coming into the workplace or onsite
- regularly clean any vehicles that workers take home
- clean things like reusable delivery boxes regularly
- minimising client contact with testers
