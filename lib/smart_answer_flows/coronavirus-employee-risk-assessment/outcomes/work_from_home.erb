    ## You should work from home if possible

    Your employer should help you work from home by:

    - discussing home working arrangements
    - ensuring you have the right equipment, for example remote access to work systems
    - including you in all necessary communications
    - looking after your physical and mental wellbeing

    If your employer wants you to return to work, you can go back as long as the workplace is [Covid-secure](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19)
