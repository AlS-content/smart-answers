    ### Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme

    If you are an employer with a PAYE scheme, you can get support to continue paying part of your employees' salary instead of making staff redundant. This is also known as putting them 'on furlough'.

    This applies to employees who have been asked to stop working because of coronavirus, but are being kept on the payroll. HMRC will pay 80% of their wages, up to £2,500 per month.
