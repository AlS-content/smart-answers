  ##When you might not need a visa

  ###If your family member is a British citizen

  If you’ve been living with your British partner or family member in another European country, you may be able to apply for a free [‘Surinder Singh’ EEA family permit](/family-permit/surinder-singh). Eligible countries are [countries in the EU](/eu-eea), Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.

  ###If your family member is from another European country

  You can apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit) if your partner or family member is from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.

  Or if they were living in the UK before 31 December 2020, you may be able to apply to the free [EU Settlement Scheme](/settled-status-eu-citizens-families). You get more rights than with a visa or family permit -  you can live, work and study in the UK for as long as you like.
