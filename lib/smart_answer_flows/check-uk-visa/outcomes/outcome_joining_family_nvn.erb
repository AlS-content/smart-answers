  Whether you need a visa depends on how long you’re staying in the UK.

  ##If you’re staying 6 months or less

  You do not need a visa if you’re visiting family or a partner for 6 months or less.

  If the family member you’re joining is from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein, you may be able to apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit). This makes it easier and quicker to enter the UK.

  ##If you’re staying longer than 6 months
  The visa you apply for depends on your family member’s situation. You can work or study if your application is successful.

  ###Your family is settled in the UK
  You may be able to apply for a [family visa](/uk-family-visa) if your family member or partner is either:

  + a British citizen
  + settled in the UK (called having 'indefinite leave to remain')

  Your family member must be your partner, child, parent, or a relative who’ll provide long-term care for you.

  ###Your family is working or studying in the UK
  You may be able to apply as a ‘dependant’ of your partner or parent’s visa if they’re working or studying in the UK.

  [Browse for your family member’s type of visa](/browse/visas-immigration) to find out how to apply.

  ###Your family member was living in the UK before 31 December 2020

  You may be able to apply to for a free [EU Settlement Scheme family permit](/family-permit/eu-settlement-scheme-family-permit) instead of applying for a visa. Your close family member must be a citizen of an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.
