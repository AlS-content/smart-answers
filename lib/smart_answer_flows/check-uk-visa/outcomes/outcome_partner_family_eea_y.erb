<% govspeak_for :body do %>
  You can apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit) to join your partner or family member for up to 6 months.

  You cannot work or study. If you plan to do these things, you may be able to apply for a visa.

  ##If you’re staying longer than 6 months

  What you can apply for depends on your family member’s situation.

  ###Your partner or family member was living in the UK before 31 December 2020

  You may be able to apply to the free [EU Settlement Scheme](/settled-status-eu-citizens-families). You get more rights than with a visa or family permit - you can live, work and study in the UK for as long as you like.

  ###Your partner or family member are working or studying in the UK

  You may be able to apply as a ‘dependant’ of your partner or family member’s visa. You can work or study if your application is successful.

  [Browse for your family member’s type of visa](/browse/visas-immigration) to find out how to apply.
