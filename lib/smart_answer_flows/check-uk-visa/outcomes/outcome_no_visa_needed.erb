      You must go to a border control officer when you arrive in the UK to get a stamp in your passport. This will allow you to study in the UK.

      ^You cannot get a stamp if you use the ePassport gates.
    <% end %>

    You should bring documents with you that show you:

      - have been accepted on a course by an [accredited institution](/study-visit-visa/eligibility) or by a UK Higher Education Institution, for example, a letter of acceptance from the institution
      - are able to fund your stay in the UK and return journey
      - intend to leave the UK at the end of your course

    You’ll also need to show:

      - details of where you intend to stay
      - contact details for at least one parent or guardian in your home country (if you’re under 18 years old)

    If you're under 18 and travelling without your parent or guardian, you'll need to provide [extra information to show they’ve given you permission](/study-visit-visa/documents-you-must-provide).

    ^ You must always have these documents with you if you’re travelling in and out of the UK during your stay. ^
