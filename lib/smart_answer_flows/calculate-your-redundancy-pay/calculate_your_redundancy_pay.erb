  Calculate how much statutory redundancy you can get. It’s based on age, weekly pay and number of years in the job.

  You only qualify for statutory redundancy pay if you’ve worked for your employer for at least 2 years.

  ^If you earned less than usual because you were 'on furlough' under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, use what you would have earned normally when calculating your redundancy pay, not what you were paid while on furlough.
