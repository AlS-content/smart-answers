  Parents must register the birth in the country where the child was born - find out if you can also register the birth in the UK
<% end %>

<% content_for :body do %>
  $!You must register your child’s birth according to the regulations in the country where the child was born. They’ll give you a local birth certificate.$!

  This local birth certificate should be accepted in the UK, eg when you apply for a passport or register with a school or doctor. You might need to have it [translated and certified](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document) if it isn’t in English.

  Once you’ve registered locally you may also be able to register the birth with the UK authorities. You can only do this if the child was born on or after 1 January 1983.

  You don’t need to register with the UK authorities but it means:

  - the birth will be recorded with the General Register Offices or at the National Records Office of Scotland
  - you can order a consular birth registration certificate

  ^You can still [apply for a UK passport for your child](/apply-renew-passport) even if you don’t register the birth in the UK.^

###If you work with HM Armed Forces abroad

You may be able to register a birth abroad with the Ministry of Defence if you’re working abroad and you’re one of the following:

- a civilian working with HM Armed Forces 
- working for an organisation that is connected to the armed forces, for example the British Red Cross
- a member of HM Armed Forces  - or their spouse 

Contact the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre (JCCC) to check your eligibility.
