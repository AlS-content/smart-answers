  $!You must register your child’s birth according to the regulations in the country where the child was born. They’ll give you a local birth certificate.$!

  This local birth certificate should be accepted in the UK, for example when you apply for a passport or register with a school or doctor. You might need to have it [translated and certified](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document) if it isn’t in English.

  ^You can still [apply for a UK passport for your child](/apply-renew-passport) even if you don’t register the birth in the UK.^

##Register an overseas birth in the UK

  Once you’ve registered locally you may also be able to register the birth with the UK authorities. You can only do this if the child was born on or after 1 January 1983.

  You don’t need to register with the UK authorities but it means:

  - the birth will be recorded with the General Register Offices or at the National Records Office of Scotland
  - you can order a consular birth registration certificate

It costs £150.00 to register an overseas birth. 

^If you're a member of HM Armed Forces or working with them, you may be able to register a birth abroad for free. [Contact the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/joint-casualty-and-compassionate-centre-jccc#contact-us) to check if you're eligible.^
