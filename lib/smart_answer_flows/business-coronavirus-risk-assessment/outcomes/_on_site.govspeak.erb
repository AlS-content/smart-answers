## Decide who should be on site 

Only essential employees and people who cannot work from home should be on site, for example because they need specialist equipment or you need them to operate safely and efficiently.

Clinically [extremely vulnerable people](/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#who-is-clinically-extremely-vulnerable) or [vulnerable people](/government/publications/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing/staying-alert-and-safe-social-distancing#clinically-vulnerable-people) should always work from home.

To keep employees safe you should:

- minimise the number of people on site
- make sure on-site employees can [spot symptoms](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/check-if-you-have-coronavirus-symptoms/)
- tell workers with symptoms to [quarantine immediately](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/what-to-do-if-you-or-someone-you-live-with-has-coronavirus-symptoms/staying-at-home-if-you-or-someone-you-live-with-has-coronavirus-symptoms/)
- explain new procedure and provide training where necessary

To support employees working remotely you should:

- provide the right equipment for people to work from home
- keep remote and on-site employees connected
- send updates to employees when the situation changes
- make sure disabled workers and new and expectant mothers can do their work from home (you have a responsibility to [prevent discrimination at work](/employer-preventing-discrimination))
- [look after peopleâ€™s mental health](/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-the-public-on-mental-health-and-wellbeing/guidance-for-the-public-on-the-mental-health-and-wellbeing-aspects-of-coronavirus-covid-19)
