## How to ensure social distancing on site

You should always:

- stay 2 meters apart from other employees and customers
- put up signs to remind people to social distance
- keep the number of people on site to a minimum
- wash your hands and clothes after helping someone in an emergency
- make sure employees [wear face covering safely](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/working-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19/construction-and-other-outdoor-work#outdoors-6-1) although there’s no legal requirement to wear it

Where you cannot stay 2 meters apart, you should:

- only work together up to 15 minutes at a time
- wash hands and clean surfaces regularly
- use screens and barriers to separate people where possible
- work side by side or back-to-back rather than face-to-face
- have fixed teams to minimise exposure

### Entrances and exits

You should:

- stagger arrival and departure times
- open more entrances and exits to the site
- use screens in reception areas
- mark a one-way flow where possible
- provide hand washing facilities or hand sanitiser
- provide more parking
- provide facilities to help people cycle, run or walk to work, for example bike racks
- make sure people touch things as little as possible, for example deactivate turnstyles and keypads

### Moving around the site

You should:

- close off areas that are not essential
- reduce the number of people using lifts
- put up signs to use stairs instead of lifts whenever possible
- keep workstations 2 meters apart where possible
- avoid sharing workstations, for example by assigning employees to one role
- avoid people passing objects, for example by having drop-off stations
- have a dedicated space for each team (you might have to change the layout of your site)
- ask people to store personal items in lockers if possible
- control the use of corridors, lifts and similar areas, for example with markings on the floor
- make sure transport around the site is not crowded and drivers are protected
- have 2 meter floor markings where people queue, for example toilets, changing rooms and other common areas
- stagger break times and, if possible, have breaks outdoors
- use freed up space from people working remotely to create break areas
- arrange seating in break areas 2 meters apart
- provide packaged meals instead of opening the canteen
