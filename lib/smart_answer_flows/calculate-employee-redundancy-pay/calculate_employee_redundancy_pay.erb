  Calculate an employee’s statutory redundancy pay.

  Redundancy payments are based on age, weekly pay and number of years in the job.

  Employees only qualify if they’ve worked at least 2 full years for you.

  ^If your employee earned less than usual because they were 'on furlough' under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, use what they would have earned normally when calculating their redundancy pay, not what they earned while on furlough.
