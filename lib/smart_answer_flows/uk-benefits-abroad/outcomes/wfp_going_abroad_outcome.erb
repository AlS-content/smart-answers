  You can get a [Winter Fuel Payment](/winter-fuel-payment) if you have a genuine link with the UK, for example if you’ve lived and worked in the UK for most of your life.

  You must be living in an [European Economic Area (EEA)](/eu-eea) country or Switzerland during the 3rd week of September immediately before the winter you’re claiming the Winter Fuel Payment for.

  Contact the [International Pension Centre](/international-pension-centre) to transfer your claim abroad.

  ^You cannot get the payment if you live in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta, Portugal or Spain, because the average winter temperature in these countries is higher than the warmest region of the UK.
