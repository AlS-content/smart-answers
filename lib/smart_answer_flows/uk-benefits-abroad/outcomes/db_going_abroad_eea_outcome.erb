  You might be able to carry on getting [Attendance Allowance](/attendance-allowance), [Carer's Allowance](/carers-allowance), [PIP](/pip) (daily living component) or Disability Living Allowance (care component).

  You cannot get the mobility portion of PIP and DLA.

  You can only get Carer’s Allowance if either of the following apply to the person you’re caring for:
  - they previously lived or worked in an EU country, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland or Switzerland
  - they have a parent, spouse, civil partner or partner who has lived or worked in an EU country, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland or Switzerland

  Tell the [Exportability Team](/exportability-team) at the Pension, Disability and Carers Service that you're moving abroad.
