Student finance calculator

This calculator is for students from England or the European Union (EU) starting a new undergraduate course in academic years:

+ 2017 to 2018
+ 2018 to 2019

^There will be no change to the rights and status of EU citizens living in the UK until 2021. You and your family can apply for ‘[settled status](https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/settled-status-eu-citizens-families)' to continue living in the UK after June 2021. The scheme will open fully by March 2019.^

Use the student finance calculator to estimate:

+ student loans
+ extra student funding, eg if you’re disabled or have children

Your result will be more accurate if you know your annual household income (your parents’ or partner’s income plus your own).


If you're a part-time student applying for the 2018 to 2019 academic year, you'll need to know how many credits you'll study and how many credits a full-time student would study.

Ask your university or college if you're not sure.

You can’t use the calculator if you’re from [Scotland](http://www.saas.gov.uk/), [Wales](http://www.studentfinancewales.co.uk) or [Northern Ireland.](http://www.studentfinanceni.co.uk)
